The lattice-tailed trogon is a tropical bird native to Costa Rica and Panama, made as a gift celebrating a trip to the former. Another more detailed work, and first I've done "perched" instead of free standing - I like it, how about you? This was made from plain corrugated cardboard, Lone Star, Southern Tier 2xOne, and St. Arnold White Noise boxes.
