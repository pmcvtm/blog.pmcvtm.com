I am a custom software consultant that leverages software to make **your life easier**.

I care deeply about the continued success and health of your software and teams, paying extra mind to training, documentation and understanding.

Here are some of the things I can do for you:

## .NET and Cloud Development



## DevOps Modernization and Optimization

I have extensive experience \[re-\]platforming continuous integration and delivery systems to simplify,
secure, and streamline developers' operations, across all sorts of tooling. A well-functioning and automated testing and release pipeline can save your development teams hours, avoid headaches, and elimate the potential for foibles so you can focus on the critical parts of the business and delivery.

## Technical Team Leadership

Hire me to lead one of your teams or other contractors in delivering a new feature or improvement. I will work with your project and product leaders to distill real-world requirements into technical ones, drive techical decisions, and lead developers through solution implementation, testing, and delivery.

I am available for closed-scope efforts, as well as pinch-hitting for when your lead goes on parental leave or you're in need of other temporary coverage.

## Odds and Ends

I am a "jack of many trades," pretty good at a few.

## Get in Touch
